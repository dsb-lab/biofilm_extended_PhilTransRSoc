# biofilm_extended_PhilTransRSoc

Code to run the simulations for the biofilm models proposed in:

Martinez-Corral R, Liu J, Prindle A, SÃ¼el G, Garcia-Ojalvo J. Metabolic basis of brain-like electrical signalling in bacterial communities. Philosphical Transactions of the Royal Society B. 2019. 
https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2018.0382

The simulations run in C. They are compiled and executed from Python code, in jupyter notebooks or Python scripts. Note that depending on your system configuration, you may need to modify the compilation instructions, in basic_mf_2017.
Note that the Python code is written in Python 2. 

The simulation in Figure 4 of the paper is generated from 2018_10_11_full_paper.ipynb.

The simulation in Figure 5 is generated from 2018_10_17_electric_paper.ipynb.

The simulations for Figure 6 were run in the cluster, with the code in cluster/2018_10_24_rerun_2018_05_31_DpbyGi_multseed_v16.py.
